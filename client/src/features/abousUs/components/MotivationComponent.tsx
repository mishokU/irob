                    Usov Mikhail and Vasiliy met at the end of 2022 whilst working
                    in the technology and creative industries in Russia. They both
                    wanted to find a way for film professionals to buy and sell film
                    and TV rights in a seamless and secure way, cutting out
                    additional costs. The idea of IROB was born.
